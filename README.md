In creating this project, I used MERN stack technology. This is an online first-food restaurant website. Where customers can view all food items by category and purchase any item via online payment. Admins can add new food items and delete or update any items. Also, admins can manage customer's purchase orders.

## Features:

- Login or register and connect with the Google authentication system.
- Customers can add to cart any items and review their order before confirming payments.
- Admins can manage items and customer orders. Incomplete orders can be deleted from the list.
- Separate dashboard for admins and customers.

## Technologies:

React JS - React Router - React Hook Form - Axios - Firebase - JWT - React Query - Node JS - Express JS - MongoDB - SSLCOMMERZ.
